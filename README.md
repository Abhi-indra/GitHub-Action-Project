# GitHub-Actions-and-Projects
In this repo we explain about github actions and making projects

# Understanding GitHub Actions:
## Setting Up a Workshop:
Imagine you're organizing a coding workshop in your favorite city.

## Tasks to Be Done:
In this workshop, there are various tasks to be done: writing code, testing it, and finally, deploying it.

## Coordination and Automation:
Now, think of GitHub Actions as a smart assistant who helps you coordinate and automate these tasks.

## The Assistant's Role:
Your assistant (GitHub Actions) is like a helper that watches the participants (your code) and takes care of things automatically.

## Automation Example:
For instance, if someone submits new code (a participant writes a new piece of code), the assistant (GitHub Actions) immediately checks it (runs tests) to make sure it works well.

## Keeping Things Organized:
GitHub Actions keeps everything organized, just like an efficient workshop manager. It ensures that each task is done correctly and helps you focus on the creative partâ€”writing awesome code!

## Feedback Loop:
If there's an issue (bugs in the code), GitHub Actions quickly notifies you, just like someone telling you, "Hey, there's a problem with this code!"

## Continuous Assistance:
It's like having a constant helper, making sure everything runs smoothly, from writing code to testing and deploying it. It's there to assist you in your coding journey.

# Comparing with Jenkins

## Advantages of GitHub Actions over Jenkins
- Hosting: Jenkins is self-hosted, meaning it requires its own server to run, while GitHub Actions is hosted by GitHub and runs directly in your GitHub repository.
- User interface: Jenkins has a complex and sophisticated user interface, while GitHub Actions has a more streamlined and user-friendly interface that is better suited for simple to moderate automation tasks.
- Cost: Jenkins can be expensive to run and maintain, especially for organizations with large and complex automation needs. GitHub Actions, on the other hand, is free for open-source projects and has a tiered pricing model for private repositories, making it more accessible to smaller organizations and individual developers.

## Advantages of Jenkins over GitHub Actions

- Integration: Jenkins can integrate with a wide range of tools and services, but GitHub Actions is tightly integrated with the GitHub platform, making it easier to automate tasks related to your GitHub workflow.

# Understanding GitHub Actions Runners:

In GitHub Actions, a runner is where your jobs are executed. It's analogous to Jenkins' agent or worker node, where your applications run. GitHub Actions offers two types of runners:

#### 1. GitHub Hosted Runner:

- **Purpose:**
  - Used for public projects or open-source CI builds.
  - GitHub's infrastructure hosts and manages these runners.
  - Ideal for projects like Kubernetes, ArgoCD, etc., that are directly built on GitHub.

- **Cost:**
  - GitHub Hosted Runners are free for public and open-source projects.

#### 2. Self-Hosted Runner:

- **Purpose:**
  - Preferred for private repositories or projects requiring specific configurations.
  - Offers more control over the environment and enhances security.

- **How to Attach a Self-Hosted Runner:**
  1. Create an EC2 instance.
  2. Configure inbound and outbound traffic rules (e.g., open ports 80 or 443).
  3. In GitHub settings, navigate to the project, click on Actions, and add a new self-hosted runner.
  4. Update the YAML file in your repository to use the self-hosted runner.

### Interview Questions:

1. **Why GitHub Actions for CI?**
   - For public projects, GitHub Actions provides free runners, streamlining automation.
   - For private projects: Centralized management on GitHub, simplifying workflows.

2. **How do you secure your sensitive information in github?**
   - In the repository settings, use GitHub Secrets to secure credentials and variables.

3. **How can you write CI file in github actions?**
   - Create a `.github/workflows` folder and craft YAML configurations for CI in this directory.

In conclusion, Jenkins is better suited for complex and large-scale automation tasks, while GitHub Actions is a more cost-effective and user-friendly solution for simple to moderate automation needs.
