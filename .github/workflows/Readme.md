Certainly! This GitHub Actions YAML file is a configuration for an automated workflow that runs when there is a push event to the repository. 

# Explanation:

### Workflow Trigger:
The workflow is triggered on a push event to the repository.

### Job Configuration:
The workflow defines a single job named build that runs on the latest version of the Ubuntu environment (ubuntu-latest).

### Python Version Strategy:
The job uses a matrix strategy to test the code with different Python versions (3.8 and 3.9).

### Steps:
actions/checkout@v3: Checks out the code from the repository.

### Set up Python:
actions/setup-python@v2: Sets up the specified Python version from the matrix.

### Install Dependencies:
Upgrades pip and installs the pytest library for testing.

### Run Tests:
Changes the directory to src and runs the tests using pytest on the addition.py file.

This workflow is designed for a Python project, running tests on different Python versions when there's a push to the repository. It ensures that the code remains functional across Python 3.8 and 3.9 environments.
