Certainly! This GitHub Actions YAML file is a configuration for an automated workflow that runs when there is a push event to the repository. 

# Explanation:

#### 1. Workflow Trigger:
The workflow is triggered on a push event to the repository.

#### 2. Job Configuration:
The workflow defines a single job named build that runs on the latest version of the Ubuntu environment (ubuntu-latest).

#### 4. Python Version Strategy:
The job uses a matrix strategy to test the code with different Python versions (3.8 and 3.9).

#### 5. Steps:
actions/checkout@v3: Checks out the code from the repository.

#### 6. Set up Python:
actions/setup-python@v2: Sets up the specified Python version from the matrix.

#### 7. Install Dependencies:
Upgrades pip and installs the pytest library for testing.

#### 8. Run Tests:
Changes the directory to src and runs the tests using pytest on the addition.py file.

This workflow is designed for a Python project, running tests on different Python versions when there's a push to the repository. It ensures that the code remains functional across Python 3.8 and 3.9 environments.

**Note**: If in yml file you mention the build config to ubuntu-latest than it is run on Github Hosted Runner & if it is on self-hosted runner than it is run on your own machine or instances that you configure for github actions.
